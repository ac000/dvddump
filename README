Overview
========

dvddump is a simple wrapper around dd_rescue to enable the dumping of DVD's.

It uses libdvdread to first open the DVD and thus take care of the CSS stuff.
This allows dd_rescue to then access the DVD without error.


Usage
=====

    $ dvddump <dvd-device> <outfile>

e.g

    $ dvddump /dev/sr0 dvd.iso
